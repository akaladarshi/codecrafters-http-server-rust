# RUST HTTP SERVER

[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, you'll build a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients.


1. Ensure you have `cargo (1.70)` installed locally
1. Run `./your_server.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/main.rs`. This command compiles your Rust project, so it might be slow
   the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
